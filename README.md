# Daily Planner

## Purpose - to create a daily planner that has time blocks from 9am-5pm that can be edited to add tasks.  Time blocks are colored coded to show if they are in the past, present, or future.

## This application was built using HTML, CSS, and javascript.  Jquery, Moment.JS, and Font Awesome were also used.
